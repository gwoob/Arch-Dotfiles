# Rational - How many subvolumes is too much?
# I want to rollback my machine on w whim without fear of losing something important
# I however, do not want a million subvolumes to deal with
# This is the layout I am settling on
# Inspired by:

# Btrfs Layout - JWillikers

@			/				# root subvolume
@snapshots		/.snapshots			# root subvolume snapshots
@home			/home				# home subvolume
@home.snapshots		/home/.snapshots		# home subvolume snapshots
@opt			/opt				# for third party installed add-on software
@root			/root				# root user home needs to be preserved during rollback
@tmp			/tmp				# temporary files only bloat snapshots
@usr_local		/usr/local			# for third party installed administrator utilities
@var			/var				# (DISABLE COW) contains many variable files, VM images, logs, stuff I don't want rolled back
@containers		~/.local/share/containers	# I want my container images preserved during rollback
@swap			/swap				# for swapfile
@games			~/Games				# games only bloat snapshots
